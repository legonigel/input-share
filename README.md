# Input Share Website

This branch holds the GitHub pages site for Input Share. This uses the [slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) from GitHub pages as its base.

## Previewing the site locally

If you'd like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down this repository
2. `cd` into the website's directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the site
