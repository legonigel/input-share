Input share is a fork of the Synergy Project from Synergy 1. When the owners of Synergy (Symless) moved to Synergy 2, they moved to a primarily closed source product. This project looks to continue the open source nature of the original Synergy project by maintaining a release of the last open source version of Synergy, V1.8.8.
